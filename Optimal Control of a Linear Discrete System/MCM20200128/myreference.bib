@article{MatthewGSmith:2005:GPEM,
  abstract = {The use of machine learning techniques to
                 automatically analyse data for information is becoming
                 increasingly widespread. In this paper we primarily
                 examine the use of Genetic Programming and a Genetic
                 Algorithm to pre-process data before it is classified
                 using the C4.5 decision tree learning algorithm.
                 Genetic Programming is used to construct new features
                 from those available in the data, a potentially
                 significant process for data mining since it gives
                 consideration to hidden relationships between features.
                 A Genetic Algorithm is used to determine which such
                 features are the most predictive. Using ten well-known
                 datasets we show that our approach, in comparison to
                 C4.5 alone, provides marked improvement in a number of
                 cases. We then examine its use with other well-known
                 machine learning techniques.},
